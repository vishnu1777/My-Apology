                    <p>My dearest,</p>
                    <p>They say actions speak louder than words, which is why I've created this site for you. But I also know that sometimes, words are needed too.</p>
                    <p>I've been reflecting deeply on what happened, and I want you to know that I take full responsibility for my actions. I understand why you're hurt, and your feelings are completely valid.</p>
                    <p>What we have is specialâ€”rare even. I realize now how careless I was with something so precious. The thought of losing you has made me understand just how important you are in my life.</p>
                    <p>I promise to learn from this mistake. I'm committed to being a better person and a better partner because you deserve nothing less.</p>
                    <p>I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me, but I also understand if you need time. Either way, I want you to know that you are loved, valued, and irreplaceable in my life.</p>
                    <p className="mt-6">With all my love and deepest apologies,</p>
